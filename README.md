## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ledgermall/ledgermall.git
cd ledgermall
```
---

### 2️⃣ Configure APIs & MongoDB

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a remote cluster. Create a database called `ledgermall` with two collections:
- `users`
- `products`

Configure the [config](config.yaml) file and populate with the following:

```python
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
CP_PUBLIC_KEY = "your-coinpayments-public-key" 
CP_PRIVATE_KEY = "your-coinpayments-private-key"
BUYER_EMAIL = "buyer@example.com"

COIN_MAPPING = {
    "btc": {"currency2": "BTC", "address": "your-btc-address"},
    "ltc": {"currency2": "LTC", "address": "your-ltc-address"},
    ...
}
```
> ⚠️ Keep this file secure and don’t commit it publicly.

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies & Run WebApp

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

pymongo

```
</details>

---

## 🔐 Admin Setup (Manual via MongoDB)

Create an admin user directly in the `users` collection. Sample document:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "<bcrypt_hashed_password>",
  "is_admin": true
}
```

To generate a bcrypt hash:

```python
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
bcrypt = Bcrypt()
print(bcrypt.generate_password_hash("yourpassword").decode())
```

> ⚠️ There’s no web interface to set up admin yet. Use MongoDB Compass or CLI.

---

## 🔒 Security Practices

- Use **HTTPS** in production  
- Keep **MongoDB secure** and password-protected  
- **Environment variables** for secrets (avoid plain `config.py` in production)  
- Validate & sanitize all user inputs  
- Restrict admin routes via `is_admin` checks

---

## 📊 Future Add-ons (Roadmap Ideas)

- 📨 Telegram or email order notifications  
- 🆔 Verified user tiers (KYC)  
- 🧾 Auto-generated PDF invoices  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly UI/UX  
- 🪝 REST API integration for external platforms or Telegram bots
